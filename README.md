I'm a senior software engineer / technical lead / development manager (depending on your definitions of those roles). I've programmed with Java (and the Spring Framework) for many years, but am interested in many other programming languages (such as Clojure, Python and Go) and technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform).

Two fun facts about me: (i) I was the main contributor to the MIT-licensed OpenText Dimensions Jenkins Plugin for several years (I no longer have access to OpenText Dimensions, so not any more). (ii) A long, long time ago, I won a Panasonic Smart TV in The Register's programming competition.
