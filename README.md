🎬 I'm a senior software engineer / technical lead / development manager (depending on your definitions of those roles). I've programmed with ☕ Java (and the Spring Framework) for many years, but am interested in many other programming languages (such as Clojure, Python and Go) and technologies (🐋 Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform).

📰 Mildly-interesting facts: (i) I was the main contributor to the MIT-licensed OpenText Dimensions Jenkins Plugin for several years (I no longer have access to OpenText Dimensions, so not any more). (ii) A long, long time ago, I won a 📺 Panasonic Smart TV in The Register's programming competition.
